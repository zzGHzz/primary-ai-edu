- Education-specific licensing tiers with Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)
- PDPO compliance documentation and audit certifications
- Data residency options with Hong Kong/regional processing centers
- Comprehensive audit logging and eDiscovery capabilities
- Single Sign-On (SSO) and Student Information System (SIS) integration
- Age-appropriate content filtering and safety controls
- Clearly defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with educational context

**Vendor Evaluation Process**
- **Due Diligence Framework**: [Vendor Due Diligence Checklist](vendor-due-diligence-checklist.md)
- **Comparative Analysis**: [AI Tool Comparison Matrix](ai-tool-comparison.md)
- **Risk Assessment**: [Evaluation Rubric](evaluation-rubric.md)
- **Implementation Planning**: [Pilot Evaluation Form](pilot-evaluation-form.md)

## Strategic Alignment With Current IT Infrastructure

### Leveraging Existing Google Ecosystem
**Google Classroom Enhancement**
- Expand current teacher-parent communication to include AI-enhanced progress reports
- Implement standardized guardian summaries with automated translation capabilities
- Develop consistent class naming conventions that support AI analytics
- Integrate AI-generated assignment suggestions and differentiated content delivery

**Google Workspace Optimization**
- Enhance existing Docs/Slides workflows with Gemini integration for lesson planning
- Implement AI-powered comment banks and feedback systems for streamlined grading
- Develop shared resource libraries with AI-curated content recommendations
- Create templates and rubrics that leverage AI for consistent assessment practices

**Identity & Device Management Enhancements**
- Extend current managed Google accounts with age-appropriate AI access controls
- Implement Organizational Unit (OU) based policies for different grade levels and user types
- Strengthen safe search and content filtering with AI-specific restrictions
- Develop refined third-party application access policies that support approved AI tools

### Infrastructure Readiness Assessment
**Current Strengths to Build Upon**
- Established Google Workspace for Education foundation with full user management
- Existing teacher comfort with cloud-based collaborative tools and workflows
- Operational parent communication systems ready for AI enhancement
- Proven change management experience from previous technology implementations

**Areas Requiring Enhancement**
- Advanced security controls for AI-specific data flows and processing
- Enhanced monitoring and audit capabilities for AI tool usage
- Professional development infrastructure expanded to include AI competencies
- Policy frameworks updated to address AI-specific compliance and safety requirements
