## Comparative Notes
- Google + Gemini: Strong fit with Classroom and Drive; mature admin/data controls; lowest integration effort.
- Third-party student tools (Khanmigo, Quizizz/Nearpod): useful in walled gardens; pilot only after policies/consents.
- Private gateway: maximum control; higher effort and budget.

## Integration Architecture (High Level)
- Identity: Google Workspace as source of truth; use OUs/groups for staff, students, and classes; enable guardian summaries.
- Devices/MDM: Manage browsers/devices via Google Admin; if iPad/Windows are present, add Jamf/Intune as needed; enforce safe search and content filtering.
- Data: Drive/Docs/Slides as canonical storage; prohibit uploading sensitive PII to external LLMs; restrict third‑party app access via Admin controls.
- AI Access: Gemini for Workspace primary. In later phases, at most one vetted third‑party student tool may be piloted under strict controls (see due diligence).

## Recommendation
- Adopt Google Workspace for Education with Gemini as the primary platform (aligned with current Classroom and Google accounts).
- Defer third‑party SaaS tools and custom LLM gateways until policies, consent, and data‑residency reviews are complete.
- Allow a single, narrowly scoped student tool pilot (e.g., Khanmigo) only after Phase 1, with consent and controls.
