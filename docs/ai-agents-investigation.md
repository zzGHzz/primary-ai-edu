- Single-task focus: Complete one task per interaction
- No memory: Each interaction is independent
- Full human control: Users must initiate every action

**AI Agents (Educational Context)**
- Proactive: Work toward goals with minimal human prompts
- Multi-task workflows: Handle sets of related tasks autonomously
- Contextual memory: Learn and adapt from previous interactions
- Guided autonomy: Operate independently within defined safety boundaries

- Data leakage -> strict redaction; no student identifiers; Drive-only storage.
- Inappropriate content -> multi-stage safety filters; age gates; allowlists.
- Over-reliance -> training on pedagogy-first use; reflective prompts; exemplars.

## Scope Boundaries and Logging
- Teacher-in-the-loop required for any publishing action to Drive/Classroom.
- No persistent autonomy; tasks time-boxed and auditable.
- Logs retained per policy; termly admin review. See [vendor-due-diligence-checklist.md](vendor-due-diligence-checklist.md).

## Recommendations
- Proceed with Option A (Gemini) for teacher tasks only.
- Keep all student-facing agents “assistive”, not autonomous; require teacher initiation and oversight.
- Reassess gateway/third-party options only after due diligence, consents, and regional data reviews.

## Next Steps
- Select pilot teachers/subjects and finalize scenarios.
- Configure Admin policies and logging; prepare consent and safety briefings.
- Implement add-on UI (if Option B) and connect to gateway policies.
- Schedule training and evaluation checkpoints; report results to leadership.
