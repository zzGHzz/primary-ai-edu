# Evaluation Rubric for AI Tools (Weighted)

Use this rubric to score each candidate tool for HK primary use. Weight totals 100.

| Criterion | Weight | Indicators (score 1–5) |
| --- | ---:| --- |
| Security & Compliance | 25 | DPA/contract terms; data residency options; audit logs; admin policies; PDPO alignment |
| Pedagogical Value | 25 | Age-appropriate; curriculum alignment; supports differentiation/assessment; teacher oversight |

Scoring: for each tool, rate 1–5 per criterion, multiply by weight, sum. Prefer tools scoring ≥80.

## Notes
- Student-facing tools must demonstrate strong guardrails and allow teacher-in-the-loop workflows.
- If any red flags arise in due diligence, pause and seek alternatives regardless of score.
